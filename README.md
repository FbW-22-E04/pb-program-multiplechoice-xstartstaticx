    -   "red" => print "Q1: Red's a great color on you."
    -   "blue" => print "Q1: Blue? Great choice."
    -   "green" => print "Q1: Ok. Green it is."
    -   "yellow" => print "Q1: Not what I would have picked, but yellow is fine."
    -   if the value is none of the above => print "Q1: The aim of the game is to pick a color."

## 2. Grading

Create a `switch` statement that prints different comments depending on a grade.

### Create a variable called `grade` and print the following sentence for each `grade`:

    -   "A" => print "Q2: A - Well done!"
    -   "B" => print "Q2: B - Good on you!"
    -   "C" => print "Q2: C - Good effort"
    -   "D" => print "Q2: D - Try harder next time..."
    -   if the value is none of the above => print "Q2: Yikes..."

## 3. Fruits

Create a `switch` statement that prints different statements for various fruits (banana, orange, strawberry, apple).

### Create a variable called `fruit` and print the following sentence for each `fruit` :

    -   "apple" => print "Q3: An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
    -   "banana" => print "Q3: Bananas are full of potassium."
    -   "orange" => print "Q3: Yep, oranges. Great choice."
    -   "strawberry" => print "Q3: Mmmm...nothing better than strawberries."
    -   if the value is none of the above => print "Q3: PICK A FRUIT"

## 4. Percentage Completed.

### Create a variable called `percentageComplete` and print the following sentences depending on the percentage completed :

- If `percentageComplete` is below 30, print "Q4: Still a long way to go".
- If `percentageComplete` is between 30 and 50, print "Q4: Slowly getting there".
- If `percentageComplete` is between 51 and 80, print "Q4: You can do it!".
- If `percentageComplete` is between 81 and 99, print "Q4: This is the last push!".
- If `percentageComplete` is 100, print "Q4: You're there. Well done!".
